Cunningham was a former circus performer, obsessed with peacocks, and often wore 
peacock feathers, pins, and fabrics herself. In 1949, the Royal Peacock was 
opened and owned by Carrie B. Cunningham. Egyptian revival became the decor 
(similar to the Fox Theater) and peacock feathers were cascaded down the side of the 
building from the street facing windows.
